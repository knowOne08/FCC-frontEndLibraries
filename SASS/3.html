<!-- In Sass, a mixin is a group of CSS declarations that can be reused throughout the style sheet. -->
<!-- The definition starts with @mixin followed by a custom name. The parameters (the $x, $y, $blur, and $c in the example above) are optional. Now any time a box-shadow rule is needed, only a single line calling the mixin replaces having to type all the vendor prefixes. A mixin is called with the @include directive: -->

<style type='text/scss'>

    @mixin border-radius($radius){
      -webkit-border-radius:$radius;
      -moz-border-radius:$radius;
      -ms-border-radius:$radius;
      border-radius:$radius;
    }
  
    #awesome {
      width: 150px;
      height: 150px;
      background-color: green;
      @include border-radius(15px);
    }
  </style>
  
  <div id="awesome"></div>
