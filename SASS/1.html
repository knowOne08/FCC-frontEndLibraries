<!-- One feature of Sass that's different than CSS is it uses variables. They are declared and set to store data, similar to JavaScript. -->
<!-- In Sass, variables start with a $ followed by the variable name. -->
<!-- Sass allows nesting of CSS rules, which is a useful way of organizing a style sheet. -->

<style type='text/scss'>
    $text-color: red;
    
    .header {
      text-align: $text-color;
    }
    .blog-post, h2 {
      color: $text-color;
    }
  </style>
  
  <h1 class="header">Learn Sass</h1>
  <div class="blog-post">
    <h2>Some random title</h2>
    <p>This is a paragraph with some random text in it</p>
  </div>
  <div class="blog-post">
    <h2>Header #2</h2>
    <p>Here is some more random text.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="blog-post">
    <h2>Here is another header</h2>
    <p>Even more random text within a paragraph</p>
  </div>
