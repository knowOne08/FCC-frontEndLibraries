<!-- There are many different ways you can compose components with React. -->
<!-- Component composition is one of React's powerful features. -->

<!-- You break down your UI into its basic building blocks, and those pieces become the components. This helps to separate the code responsible for the UI from the code responsible for handling your application logic. It can greatly simplify the development and maintenance of complex projects. -->
