<!-- Components are the core of React. Everything in React is a component  -->
<!-- There are two ways to create a React component. -->
<!-- 1. The first way is to use a JavaScript function. Defining a component in this way creates a stateless functional component. -->
<!-- One important thing to note is that React requires your function name to begin with a capital letter.  -->

const MyComponent = function() {

  
    return (
      <div> Hello</div> 
    );

  }
